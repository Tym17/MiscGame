# Microchisel
> Script to help you create microblocks for most chisel blocks.

## Requirements

* Node.js
* Crafttweaker installed on your server/modpack
* Forge microblocks

## Usage

Create an **old.cfg** file next to **main.js** containing all the blocks you would like to turn into microblocks from a [Crafttweaker block export](https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Vanilla/Commands/) (See old.cfg for example). Run `node main.js` and everything should be ready for you in a **new.cfg** file!
